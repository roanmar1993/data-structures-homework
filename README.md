## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile and Run

Each homework assignment is a standalone `.cpp` file. To compile and run a project:


g++ -std=c++17 "ProjectName.cpp" -o program
./program
Example:

g++ -std=c++17 "Corrupt_Hospital.cpp" -o hospital
./hospital

üß† Learning Outcomes
Through these assignments, the following concepts were applied:

Linked List Structures (Singly, Circular Doubly)

Min-Heaps and Priority Queues

Tree Traversal and Depth Search

Graph Construction and Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm

Sorting, Filtering, Deduplication

Memory Management and Pointer Safety in C++
